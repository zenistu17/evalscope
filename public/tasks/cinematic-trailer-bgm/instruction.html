<div class="instruction-content"><p>Based on your role as an Audio Engineer and Music Producer, you will produce a Cinematic BGM score for a trailer/Narrative-driven imagery. Your objective is to produce a Suspenseful Orchestral Theme of Emotion with Dark Orchestration with Epic Fantasy attributes similar to those used in the Game of Thrones series and other Epic Fantasy films.
</p>
<p>
The reference audio files that you were provided are 2 different stereo audio files "mp3": "piano&orchest.mp3", "drumsnbass.mp3"; There have been no prior Mixes to this audio before being recorded into Stereo (In order to be a stereo audio file, both audio channels must have been recorded with sound).
</p>
<p>
As to your musical score, the sounds of the second stereo file will be your "Emotional Core", thus you must create and write a Suspenseful Theme (Sound Design, arrangement) where tension and Suspense and Drama build gradually as a result of the sound materials associated with the first audio file (Drums and Bass), as well as other components recorded from other Sources.
It is expected that you edit all of the stems, as opposed to using the stems as is. One example of this would be in the "piano&orchest.mp3" stem; from 0:11-0:35 and 0:47-1:13, there are redundant and looping sections, as well as redundant and/or poorly constructed sections which need to be carefully evaluated for inclusion or exclusion; therefore, for improved pacing and tension, you will need to make a decision as to which sections should be removed, trimmed, or restructured. You should apply similar judgments to all of the stems, as the repeated sections will adversely affect the build of the music.
</p>
<p>
This project aims to develop a "full trailer audio" through the combination of all of the various stems. In order to achieve this outcome, you will need to edit out any unnecessary sections of the arrangement, develop new variations on the violin and orchestral parts, etc. to ensure the final product sounds unique and doesn't become repetitive.
</p>
<p>
The final song should start off building up to the creation of the tension and atmosphere and NOT starting with a big hit. The drums should have a powerful but well-controlled sound and should work with the orchestra to further enhance the movement of the orchestra rather than overpower it. Overall, the music should convey feelings of darkness, suspense, and a sense of victory.
</p>
<p>
Just Like' The Track Should be Mixed and Mastered to Sound Fresh with Balance to It . Remove Excess Low Mid Mud from EQ, Upper Frequencies Off the Harsh Violins and Keep Basses Defined w/o Distortion or Clipping. Use Compression to Glue All Elements together While Maintaining Dynamics/Cinematic Feel of the Track. Reverb/ Effects Should Have Width and Space, Avoid Sounding Too Distant or Only Add To The Loudness Without Adding To The Dynamic Feel of The Mix.
