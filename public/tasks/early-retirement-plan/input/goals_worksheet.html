<p>Financial Planning Goals Worksheet</p><h1>Mike and Linda Thompson</h1><p>Completed: January 8, 2026</p><h1>Retirement Vision</h1><h2>When do you want to retire?</h2><p>Mike: "I would love to retire now if we can afford it. The early retirement package feels like a good opportunity, but I need to know we will be financially secure. If the numbers do not work, I am willing to continue working, but I would like to retire no later than age 62."</p><p>Linda: "I enjoy my consulting work and plan to continue until age 62 regardless of what Mike decides. It keeps me engaged and provides some income. After 62, I would like the flexibility to work only on projects I find interesting."</p><h2>What does retirement look like to you?</h2><p>Mike: "I want to stay active - maybe volunteer, take up woodworking, spend more time with family. I do not want a luxury lifestyle, but I want to be comfortable and not worry about money."</p><p>Linda: "Travel is important to us. We have always said we would travel more when Mike retired. I also want to help with grandchildren if Jason or Katie have kids in the next few years."</p><h1>Lifestyle &amp; Spending Goals</h1><h2>Current Monthly Spending</h2><p>Our current spending is approximately $8,500-$9,000 per month (see client profile for breakdown).</p><p>We feel this is comfortable but not extravagant.</p><h2>Expected Changes in Retirement</h2><p>Increases:</p><p>   - Travel: We want to budget $15,000-$20,000 per year for travel</p><p>   - Healthcare: We know this will increase significantly before Medicare</p><p>   - Hobbies: Mike wants to set up a woodworking shop (~$5,000 one-time)</p><p>Decreases:</p><p>   - Work-related expenses (commuting, lunches, clothing): ~$300/month</p><p>   - 401(k) contributions will stop</p><p>Overall: We expect our spending needs to be similar or slightly higher in early retirement, then potentially decrease after age 75.</p><h1>Family Goals</h1><h2>Children</h2><p>Jason (28): Financially independent. No support needed.</p><p>Katie (25): Completing MBA in May 2026. We have been helping with some living expenses (~$500/month). This will end when she graduates and gets a job.</p><p>Home Down Payment Gifts:</p><p>We would like to help each child with $50,000 toward a home down payment when they are ready to buy. Jason might be ready in the next 2-3 years. Katie probably 4-5 years out.</p><p>Total: $100,000 in gifts over the next 5 years</p><p>Education: No more education funding needed for either child.</p><h2>Grandchildren (Future)</h2><p>Neither child has children yet, but we would like to help with future grandchildren education if we can afford it. This is a "nice to have" not a requirement.</p><p>Potential 529 contributions: $5,000-$10,000 per grandchild at birth if financially feasible.</p><h1>Legacy &amp; Estate Goals</h1><h2>What do you want to leave behind?</h2><p>Mike: "I want to make sure Linda is taken care of first and foremost. After that, I would like to leave something meaningful to the kids - not necessarily a huge inheritance, but enough to make a difference."</p><p>Linda: "I agree. We do not need to leave millions, but it would be nice to leave each child $250,000-$500,000 in today dollars. If we can do more, great, but that is not the priority."</p><h2>Charitable Giving</h2><p>Current giving: ~$5,000/year to various charities (church, local food bank, university)</p><p>Future plans: We would like to maintain this level. Not planning major charitable bequests at this time.</p><h2>Current Estate Documents</h2><p>- Wills: Last updated 2018 (need review)</p><p>- Revocable Living Trust: Yes, funded with real estate</p><p>- Powers of Attorney: Healthcare and Financial POA in place</p><p>- Beneficiary Designations: Should be reviewed</p><h1>Risk Tolerance &amp; Investment Philosophy</h1><h2>How would you react to a 20% portfolio decline?</h2><p>Mike: "It would be uncomfortable, but I have been through 2008 and 2020. I know markets recover. As long as we have enough in safe assets to cover a few years of spending, I can ride it out."</p><p>Linda: "I am slightly more conservative than Mike. I do not want to see our retirement derailed by a bad market. I would prefer a more balanced approach as we get closer to needing the money."</p><h2>Investment Preferences</h2><p>- Prefer low-cost index funds (have used Vanguard and Fidelity)</p><p>- No interest in individual stock picking</p><p>- Open to some international diversification</p><p>- Not interested in alternative investments or complex products</p><p>- Prefer simplicity over optimization</p><h1>Concerns &amp; Questions</h1><h2>Top Concerns</h2><p>1. Healthcare costs before Medicare - this is our biggest worry</p><p>2. What if the market drops significantly right after Mike retires?</p><p>3. Are we taking the pension the right way (lump sum vs. annuity)?</p><p>4. When should we start Social Security?</p><p>5. Should we do Roth conversions?</p><p>6. What happens if one of us needs long-term care?</p><h2>Questions for the Advisor</h2><p>1. Can we afford for Mike to retire now, or is it too risky?</p><p>2. What is the "right" answer on the pension - we have heard arguments both ways</p><p>3. How much can we safely spend each year without running out of money?</p><p>4. What tax strategies should we consider in early retirement?</p><p>5. Should we keep or sell the rental property?</p><h1>Other Relevant Information</h1><p>Health Status:</p><p>- Mike: Generally good health. Takes medication for high blood pressure (controlled). Father died at 78 (heart disease), mother alive at 84.</p><p>- Linda: Excellent health. No medications. Mother died at 82 (cancer), father alive at 87.</p><p>Rental Property Plans:</p><p>We are open to selling the rental property if it makes sense financially. Management is getting tiresome, but the cash flow is nice. Current tenants are good but lease ends August 2026.</p><p>Relocation:</p><p>No plans to move out of California in the near term. Long-term (age 70+), might consider somewhere with lower cost of living.</p>
