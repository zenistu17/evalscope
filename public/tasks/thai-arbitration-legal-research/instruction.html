<div class="instruction-content"><p>You are an experienced attorney who specializes in international arbitration, having represented various clients in international arbitration forums such as the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) and International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). You represent Company Y, the Respondent in the present dispute. 
</p>
<p>
With this experience in mind, first examine the documents contained in the "facts.docx" document in relation to the case of the Respondent. Then, based on the documents examined from the "facts.docx,"  assess whether the High Court erred in the exercise of its discretion in making this decision. In setting aside the arbitral tribunal's interim award dated December 1, 2009, did the High Court find that such decision was based on the tribunal's view that the concluding agreement dated February 4, 2008, which had been confirmed by the tribunal to have legal validity under both Singapore and Thailand, should have been determined to be an illegitimate agreement for the purpose of stifling action for the commission of non-compoundable forgery in Thailand, and for that reason was incongruent with Singaporean public policy?
</p>
<p>
The intention of this research is to collect legal principles and precedents that are internationally enforceable and are supportive of the Respondent's claims being that the High Court correctly set aside the Interim Award under Article 34(2)(b)(ii) as the Concluding Agreement illegally stifles non-compoundable Thai forgery prosecutions, conflicting with Singapore public policy, warranting independent curial review beyond the Tribunal's literal findings.

<p>
Having understood what your research is to accomplish and what your arguments are concerning this particular issue, separate this issue into its respective components (sub-issues) in a manner that allows you to easily substantiate the arguments on behalf of the Respondent. Each sub-issue should include the relevant information and use the supporting evidence provided by the facts contained in the supporting documents in conjunction with the applicable legal authority as well as relevant decisions of international courts. Cite at least 2-5 international decisions pertaining to each sub-issue. Each international decision must carry its corresponding citation. 
</p>
<p>
After providing the titles of the international decisions applicable to the sub-issues, please summarize the international decisions and if possible, explain how the judgement supports the Respondent's positions on the sub-issues under consideration.
</p>
<p>
Do not phrase it like legal pleadings. The explanation of how a relevant decision applies to a particular sub-issue should be provided separately after providing the titles and citations of all decisions relating to a sub-issue.
