<p>Company Y (Respondent) has argued that Article 34(2)(b)(ii) of the UNCITRAL Model Law allows the High Court to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction and to undertake an independent evaluation of the Tribunal’s erroneous finding of fact and law on the validity of the Concluding Agreement, thus deciding that the Concluding Agreement was made in contravention of the law of the jurisdiction in which the Concluding Agreement applies (Singapore) and of the jurisdiction in which the Concluding Agreement is to be performed (Thailand). In that respect, Company Y believes the Tribunal has mischaracterized the Concluding Agreement as a lawful agreement entered into in order to prevent the prosecution of non-compoundable offences of forgery (joint forgery) and of the use of forged documents, and in doing so, violated the public policy of Singapore and undermined the administration of justice in Singapore, while simultaneously infringing on Singapore's obligations of comity under international law.</p><p>Moreover, Company Y argues that the Tribunal's analysis was limited to a literal interpretation of Clause 1, in which the term "Closing Date" meant when the relevant evidence had been delivered to the Thai authorities terminating "Criminal Proceedings," and ignored the context of other documents surrounding the negotiations, including draft agreements dated 4 December 2007, which contained obligations to withdraw as set out in Clause 5 of that draft agreement and the letter from Company Y's Counsel dated 18 December 2007, which stated that company Y would only agree to release its defence and testify under non-prosecution agreements for both fraud and forgery. The parties clearly intended for Company A to obtain the complete cessation of all Charges based on the language and meaning of the Concluding Agreement, which included Charges that Company A was not able to withdraw unilaterally.</p><p>Company A validly withdrew a charge of fraud under Thai law on February 7, 2008. However, in the case of forgery, it was necessary for the prosecution to use its discretion (the Prosecutor’s letter dated March 7, 2008, and the Non-Prosecution Order dated June 10, 2008, both of which indicated “insufficient evidence”). The payment of $470,000.00 on March 10, 2008, was made to facilitate this corrupt activity and so invalidates the Agreement. To enforce the Tribunal’s validation is against public policy and facilitates the wrongful use of the foreign criminal process.</p><p>Arbitral finality is generally upheld (IAA s 19B), but given that the illegality of the underlying contract was apparent from the records available (no new evidence required), therefore Respondent argues for public policy to determine curial intervention in this matter. The High Court's ability to re-examine findings on the underlying issue of illegality (Soleimany v Soleimany QB 785) was to weigh the balance between finality and the risk of providing judicial endorsement of criminal action, as such is particularly relevant given that under Thai law the underlying causes of action are all non-compoundable (Shripad v Sanikatta [AIR 1945 Bom 82]) and considerations of comity (Regazzoni v KC Sethia AC 301).</p><p>The primary question to be answered is as follows: Whether the High Court erred in the exercise of its discretion in making this decision? In setting aside the arbitral tribunal's interim award dated December 1, 2009, did the High Court find that such decision was based on the tribunal's view that the concluding agreement dated February 4, 2008, which had been confirmed by the tribunal to have legal validity under both Singapore and Thailand, should have been determined to be an illegitimate agreement for the purpose of stifling action for the commission of non-compoundable forgery in Thailand, and for that reason was incongruent with Singaporean public policy?</p><p>This can be divided into four major sub-issues: </p><ol><li>Whether the court has the power to re-examine the Tribunal’s legality findings on the grounds of public policy?</li><li>Whether agreements that stifle non-compundable prosecutions are illegal? </li><li>Whether foreign requirements render the contract unenforceable?</li><li>Whether there is scope for set-asides in the Model Law or IAA?</li></ol><p><strong>SUB ISSUE 1: </strong>Whether the court has the power to re-examine the Tribunal’s legality findings on the grounds of public policy?</p><p><strong>Case Laws: </strong></p><p>The Court of Appeal in<strong> Soleimany v. Soleimany QB 785</strong>, provided that:</p><p>If the legal status of an agreement that gives rise to an arbitral award is in question, then the court cannot automatically accept the opinion of the Arbitrator regarding the legality of that agreement; rather, the court must perform its own judgment as to whether it is proper to provide full faith and credit to the award. The court should determine:</p><p>(a) if the Arbitrator found that the contract was legal</p><p>(b) if there was any reason to question the competency of the Arbitrator.</p><p>(c) whether the parties to the arbitration were engaged in collusion.</p><p>The decision in <strong>Westacre Investments Inc v. Jugoimport-SPDR Holding Co. Ltd. QB 740</strong>, confirmed on appeal, states that where an arbitral tribunal has considered and ruled on the question of illegality, the court maintains jurisdiction over the enforcement of that arbitration award and may decline to enforce it on the basis of the arbitrators finding of illegality.</p><p>The Singapore Court of Appeal in <strong>PT Asuransi Jasa Indonesia v. Dexia Bank SA 1 SLR(R) 597</strong>, stated that the public policy exception applies only in cases where the enforcement of the arbitration award would shock the conscience, would cause serious harm to the public good, or would be entirely unacceptable behaviour as viewed by the reasonable man.</p><p>In the case of <strong>Omnium de Traitement et de Valorisation SA v Hilmarton Ltd [2001] 2 Lloyd's Rep 222</strong>, the English High Court has held that "Illegality and public policy are two sides of the same coin; courts are capable of independently determining whether to enforce the award where the enforcement is to facilitate an illegality."</p><p><strong>Implication to Sub-Issue 1: </strong></p><p>These cases allow the High Court (as in the present matter) to conduct its own investigation into the Tribunal's finding of the legality of the award notwithstanding the Tribunal's own conclusion. The existence of materials indicating the party's intention to negotiate with a view to obtaining a non-prosecution order with regard to charges of non-compoundable forgery arise from Soleimany's initial interrogation of the Tribunal and were accepted by the Tribunal as being legally valid with no evidence of incompetent or collusive conduct. Nevertheless, Westacre and PT Asuransi justify re-examination of a Tribunal's finding of legality in circumstances where illegality has been determined as undermining the administration of justice, and thus provide strong support to the Respondent's submission that the interests of public policy demand that the Court intervene beyond mere deference to the finality of arbitral awards.</p><p><strong>SUB ISSUE 2: Whether agreements that stifle non-compundable prosecutions are illegal? </strong></p><p><strong>Case Laws: </strong></p><p><strong>​​Shripad v Sanikatta Co-operative Salt Sale Society AIR 1945 Bom 82</strong> (Bombay High Court): "In the case of a non-compoundable offence... an agreement not to prosecute or directed towards its withdrawal is against public policy... The test is whether any part of the consideration consisted of a promise to stifle such proceedings" (at 84–85).</p><p><strong>Bhowanipur Banking Corp v Durgesh Nandini Dassi AIR 1941 PC 95 (Privy Council): </strong>"Agreements to stifle prosecution of serious offences are void as contrary to public policy, particularly where the complainant lacks power to withdraw cognizance once taken."</p><p><strong>Ouseph Poulo v Catholic Union Bank AIR 1965 SC 166 (Supreme Court of India):</strong> "An agreement, the object of which is to prevent or stifle prosecution for a non-compoundable offence, is opposed to public policy and void, even if indirectly implied."</p><p><strong>Windhill Local Board of Health v Vint (1890) 45 Ch D 351 </strong>(English Court of Appeal): "No court will lend its aid to the enforcement of an agreement which has for its object the stifling of a public prosecution."</p><p><strong>Application to sub issue 2: </strong></p><p>Authorities establish that condition precedent of the Association shall have been met (non-prosecution evidence for all Criminal Proceedings, including non-compoundable forgery) with each having been prosecuted illegally as claimed by Respondents Legal Counsel through their correspondence dated December 18 2007 (there).</p><p>Essentially, the determination of criminal offence establishes that the payment of US$470,000 constitutes illicit/tainted/invalid consideration because, as stated above, public authority must cease all prosecution against Respondent in order for the payment to stand.</p><p>The authorities relied upon mirror the test established by Shripad and further illustrate that Respondent's position that the Tribunal's interpretation of Clause 1 was erroneous in its literal reading and not, as was intended by the drafters, to indicate the desire of both Parties to terminate all Charges and therefore invalidate the Agreement pursuant to Singapore law.</p><p><strong>SUB ISSUE 3: Whether foreign requirements render the contract unenforceable?</strong></p><p><strong>Case Laws: </strong></p><p><strong>Regazzoni v K C Sethia (1944) Ltd AC 301 (House of Lords)</strong>: A foreign law prohibits enforcement of a contract. If the parties to the agreement could not have performed the terms of the agreement because it would have involved committing acts against foreign law, they cannot hold each other liable for lack of performance under the agreement.</p><p>In <strong>Foster v Driscoll 1 KB 470 (English Court of Appeal</strong>), it was held that the contract would not be enforced because the object of the agreement, which involved performing acts that were illegal in the foreign jurisdiction, was no longer valid. A contract that contains a condition that prevents completion of the contract based on an illegality under the laws of either the foreign jurisdiction (or the country in which the contract was executed) and the law of the jurisdiction where performance took place is unenforceable.</p><p>The Singapore Court of Appeal ruling in the case of <strong>Peh Teck Quee v Bayerische Landesbank Girozentrale 3 SLR(R) 842 (Singapore Court of Appeal)</strong> states, "Any agreement, by its terms, the object of which is to breach International comity i.e. to perform an act which is prohibited or illegal in a friendly nation of the Foreign National, shall be deemed contrary to Public Policy and therefore void."</p><p>In <strong>Lemenda Trading Co. Ltd. V. African Middle East Petroleum Co. Ltd. QB 448 (English Queen's Bench)</strong> , the English courts have declined to enforce contracts requiring performance of an illegal act contrary to the national laws or international obligation of the nations where such illegal acts took place, even though they would be considered lawful or acceptable in the United Kingdom.</p><p><strong>Application to sub-issue 3:</strong></p><p>The laws of Thailand treat forgery (or using forged documents) as a non-compoundable offense which rendered the performance (to obtain a non-prosecution order) under the Concluding Agreement as illegal under Thai law. The cases of Regazzoni and Peh Teck Quee are directly applicable to this issue: enforcing validation by the Tribunal (as indicated by the award) would be a violation of comity with Thailand (a friendly jurisdiction) in a way that does not involve domestic choice-of-law considerations. Therefore, the High Court's conclusion that the Tribunal ignored the requirements of foreign performance, as evidenced by correspondence from the Thai authorities, justifies the award being set aside.</p><p><strong>SUB ISSUE 4:Whether there is scope for set-asides in the Model Law or IAA?</strong></p><p><strong>Case Laws: </strong></p><p><strong>Sui Southern Gas Co Ltd v Habibullah Coastal Power Co (Pte) Ltd 3 SLR 1 (Singapore Court of Appeal</strong>)- "Public policy" is a very limited category and only applies to extreme cases where there has been a serious violation of the underlying principles of justice or morality in Singapore. Courts will conduct a comprehensive review of the evidence once a legitimate objection to the validity of an arbitral award is filed.</p><p><strong>Denmark Skibstekniske Konsulenter A/S v Ultrapolis 3000 Investments Ltd 3 SLR 661 (Singapore High Court)</strong>: In cases where a contract that is illegal has been enforced by arbitrators, courts will review and consider the circumstances surrounding the contract (including testing whether there may have been any abuse of process) prior to issuing decisions on the public policy challenge.</p><p><strong>John Holland Pty Ltd v Toyo Engineering Corp 1 SLR(R) 443 (Singapore Court of Appeal</strong>)- The question of whether public policy has been offended will trigger the production of detailed evidence in order for the Court to make an assessment of the public policy defence. Courts in Singapore will not give significant weight to the decision of the Tribunal, unless the circumstances show appropriate reliance on its determination.</p><p><strong>Dallah Estate v Ministry of Religious Affairs 3 WLR 1472 (UK Supreme Court)</strong>: Even if a Tribunal has determined that a particular matter is not contrary to the public policy of Singapore, the Independent Court retains the power to reconsider and re-examine any determination made by the Tribunal relating to public policy and will issue a decision based upon the evidence produced at the original hearing.</p><p><strong>Application to sub issue 4: </strong></p><p>The Singapore-specific Model Law cases indicate that the High Court does an exacting review in rejecting Tribunal's deference where illegality/public policy is relevant, as was done here. The Sui Southern decision confirms that after the initial threshold (completed by non-compoundable stifling) has been reached, a full rehearing must be held, thereby rejecting the Appellant's claim of finality, and confirming the Respondent's affidavits showing the Agreement's illegal purpose through the drafts and correspondence.</p>
