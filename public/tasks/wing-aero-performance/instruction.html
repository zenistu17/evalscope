<div class="instruction-content"><p>Your main purpose as an engineer working on hypercar aerodynamics and vehicle dynamics will be to generate computational model outputs. The model should be based on a reference framework (CAD of the cross-section of a complex rear wing) of aerodynamics engineering principles used in hypercar architectures. Therefore, the information included in the reference framework will have been tested and found to be valid to model hypercar performance.
</p>
<p>
The one end goal of this project is to develop the framework to model the aerodynamic and pressure relationships of a hypercar based on the previous and referenced material. The calculations for all forces, loads, and pressures should be determined using CFD analysis by Ansys Fluent.
</p>
<p>
Your output should show the rear wing downforce and drag at various speeds using basic aerodynamic principles, finite-wing corrections, and airfoil lift values; the total downforce produced by the rear wing on the vehicle should be found, along with an appropriate design value for future reference, so that the total downforce produced by the vehicle can be accurately calculated. The model also needs to include flow control effects, with respect to drag reduction due to high-velocity jet actuation (HVJ) and appropriate graphs to represent the same.
</p>
<p>
Outputs generated by the software must clearly indicate both the correct units and logical groupings of the resulting values based on relationships between the dependent variables. It must also be sufficiently documented for engineering purposes and further use.
