<p><strong>FACTS OF THE DISPUTE</strong></p><p>On 16 July 2003 (the Contract Date), Company X and Company A the Appellant, reached a five-year agreement whereby Company A would hold an annual tennis tournament in Bangkok for five years, from 2003 to 2007. The Contract was subject to the laws of Hong Kong and any issues arising from the Contract were to be resolved through arbitration in Singapore in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.</p><p>​Following the Contract Date, disputes began to arise between the parties thus leading to the commencement of arbitration to resolve any disputes as to the enforcement of rights under the Contract. By virtue of the assignment of Company X's rights, Company Y, the Respondent, served a notice of arbitration on Company A on 21 August 2006. The appointment of the Arbitral Tribunal was made, and parties were notified of such on 16 January 2007, in respect to SIAC Arbitration No 86 of 2006.</p><p>Approximately three months after Company A had received a Notice of Arbitration at the company’s request, Company A lodged a complaint against M , the sole shareholder and director of Company Y, Company X and Company Z, an entity associated with M with the Special Prosecutor's Office of Thailand for Fraud. Company A claims they were defrauded by those parties who convinced them to enter into a contract based on false representations that Company Z had the rights to enter into a tournament arrangement with them for 5 years, while Company Z only had the rights for 3 years (Company X was the contracting party per M's request).</p><p>The Complaint was also filed with a forged document, which was supposedly issued by Company W Ltd, containing an authorization for Company Z to hold the tournament for a period of 5 years beginning in 2003. As a result, Thai authorities have commenced investigations against M, Company X, and Company Z for their joint involvement in the alleged fraud (which is specifically compoundable under the laws of Thailand), joint forgery and use of a forged document (the latter is not compoundable under Thai law, herein referred to as "the Charges").</p><p>Negotiations and execution of the Concluding Agreement occurred during the aforementioned Thai criminal proceedings. The negotiations resulted in a settlement agreement between Company A, Company Y, M, Company X and Company Z that was executed on February 4, 2008 and governed by Singaporean law. Among other key terms is the definition of Closing Date, being the date that Company A receives confirmation from the Thai authorities that they have withdrawn, suspended or otherwise stopped all Criminal Proceedings against the aforementioned parties. </p><p>- Proposed Final Settlement Amount ("Agreed Final Settlement Amount") of US$470,000 by Company A to Company Y on Closing Date;</p><p> - Termination of all arbitration and legal proceedings on Closing Date, upon payment;</p><p> - All claims between Company A and other parties are considered completely settled.</p><p>Complaint Withdrawal by Company A: On February 7, 2008, shortly after the execution of the agreement, Company A withdrew its fraud complaint from the Thai authorities.</p><p>Initial Response of the Thai Authorities: On March 7, 2008, the Thai prosecutorial authority advised Company A that:</p><p> - they would be issuing an order to cease the investigation into the alleged fraud committed by M, Company X and Company Z as a result of the withdrawal of the complaint by Company A; and </p><p> - they would be issuing an opinion to not prosecute M for forgery or the use of a forged document. Company A sent a copy of the letter to Company Y on the same day.</p><p>Demand for Payment from M, compliance by Company A: M claimed on March 10, 2008, that Company A was in default by not having made payment on the Closing Date, March 7, 2008. M demanded payment by March 11, 2008 and Company A complied.</p><p>Formal Non-Prosecution Order against M: On June 10, 2008, the Thai authorities issued a formal Non-Prosecution Order against M concerning the forgery charges, citing insufficient evidence.</p><p>On June 18, 2008, Company A provided an assurance letter to Company Y, M, Company X and Company Z regarding Company Y's continuing concerns. The letter stated that Company A had no intention to re-open, re-initiate, or proceed with the Charges either now or in the future, and that Company A requested to terminate arbitration by June 25, 2008.</p><p>On June 25, 2008, M replied on behalf of Company Y that Company A had not fully complied because Company Y believed that the Concluding Agreement should have resolved all matters related to Thailand; and that the Non-Prosecution Order did not satisfy Company Y's needs because, technologically, Company Y was able to reactivate forgery charges with any kind of evidence (including false).</p><p>On June 30, 2008, Company A submitted an application to the tribunal in accordance with UNCITRAL Article 34(1) in order to terminate the arbitration on the grounds that there was an existing settlement of all matters between the parties as a result of the Signing Agreement. The validity of the Signing Agreement was challenged by Company Y on the grounds of duress, menace and/or illegality.</p><p>The Tribunal issued its sixth directive (Order #6) on August 13, 2008 to Company Y to make an application to the Singapore High Court by October 13, 2008 to set aside the Signing Agreement. Company Y did not comply, but on December 16, 2008, the parties agreed to refer to the Tribunal the issue of whether or not the Signing Agreement was void due to duress/menace and/or illegality; to confirm the Tribunal's jurisdiction as unappealable; to agree that if the Signing Agreement was valid, then arbitration would cease at once; and if the Signing Agreement was void, then arbitration would continue; and that Company Y would not challenge anything else in any other court or tribunal or jurisdiction.</p><p>The tribunal delivered its Interim Award on December 1, 2009 after holding a five-day hearing at which it found: (i) The Conclusive Agreement was not illegal and was not illegally performed by Company A; (ii) There was no duress or undue influence; and (iii) Company A did not bribe anyone in connection with obtaining the Non-Prosecution Order. The tribunal determined that the Conclusive Agreement was valid and enforceable, and accordingly, terminated the arbitration.</p><p>Company Y's Application to Set Aside the Interim Award: Following the Tribunal's award, Company Y filed an application on March 2, 2010, with the High Court of Singapore to set aside the Tribunal's Interim Award pursuant to Section 34(2)(b)(ii) of the Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration, and Section 24(b) of the IAA (Natural Justice). Company Y alleged that the Conclusive Agreement: (i) stifled Company Y's prosecution of Company A for non-compoundable theft; (ii) was contrary to both Thai law and Singapore law; and (iii) involved bribery.</p><p><strong>EXHIBIT D1: Tennis Tournament Agreement - Arbitration Clause</strong></p><p>All authorizations and provisions outlined under Clause 23 (Governance and Arbitration) of the Tennis Tournament Agreement dated 16 July 2003 Between Company X and Company A will be governed and interpreted under Hong Kong law; any disputes that may arise during the term of this Agreement will be resolved in accordance with the then-existing UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules through arbitration conducted at the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC). Each company will appoint one of their company's office-holders to act as an arbitrator, with the two appointed arbitrators selecting the third arbitrator from among themselves; the arbitration will take place in English; and the final decision made by the arbitrators will be binding on both parties.</p><p><strong>EXHIBIT D2- Notice of Arbitration dated 21 August 2006: </strong></p><p>The breach of Contract by Company A for not fulfilling all obligations stated in the Contract regarding the Annual Bangkok Tennis Match from 2003 through 2007 caused damages to Company Y - all of which exceed [amount]. The governing provisions of this Arbitration Agreement are Clause 23, as per Hong Kong law, that all disputes will be submitted to Arbitration conducted in accordance with UNCITRAL arbitration, which will take place in Singapore. Company Y has named [name of arbitrator] as one of its arbitrators and will have 30 days following the service of this notice to nominate an arbitrator. The place of Arbitration is the Singapore International Arbitration Centre ("SIAC"). </p><p><strong>EXHIBIT D3- Direction Order No.6 dated 13 August 2008</strong></p><p>Company Y is to apply to the High Court to have the Concluding Agreement set aside, on the basis of Company A's application for termination of the arbitration (via UNCITRAL Article 34(1)), and Company Y's defence to that application, citing duress, by the 13 October 2008 deadline, with failure to comply with this order resulting in waiver of this defence, and subsequently to set the hearing on termination after any compliance.</p><p><strong>EXHIBIT D4- Jurisdiction Agreement</strong></p><p>Company Y and Company A irrevocably agree to refer the issue of whether the Concluding Agreement signed on 4 February 2008 should be set aside/declared void or otherwise on the basis of duress, undue influence and/or illegally to the Tribunal, which has jurisdiction to decide the matter. If the Concluding Agreement is held to be valid, the arbitration will terminate upon its being rendered void, and the arbitration will continue if the Concluding Agreement is held to be void. Company Y confirms that it will not contest the validity or enforceability of this Agreement in any other forum or jurisdiction. [The respective Counsel signing for Company Y and Company A].</p><p><strong>EXHIBIT D5- Interim Award dated 01 December 2009</strong></p><p>The Interim Award below dates to 01-12-2009 in accordance with the UNCITRAL Rules, where the Concluding Agreement validity was ruled upon on 16-12-2008. </p><p>Findings: (a) The Concluding Agreement is valid and enforceable. It is not illegal and does not impose any obligation upon Company A to procure a non-prosecution order from the Thai Public Prosecutor and both parties acknowledged that it is at the discretion of the Thai Public Prosecutor to proceed with prosecution or not; (b) There was no evidence of duress or undue influence; (c) The allegation of bribery was unsubstantiated. Decision: The Arbitration was terminated as a result of the agreement referenced above, therefore there would be no further claims to adjudicate. Costs were reserved in respect of any subsequent proceedings and the Tribunal signed on the date referenced above.</p><p><strong>EXHIBIT D6: Concluding Agreement dated 04-02-2008</strong></p><p>This agreement is between Company A, Company Y (M who is the sole shareholder and director of Company Y), Company X, and Company Z and is governed by Singapore law.</p><p>Clauses: 1) Closing Date - defined as the date when Company A has evidence of cessation of all criminal proceedings against M and Companies X and Z in relation to the joint fraudulent actions of forgery and use of forged documents, by the Thai Public Prosecutor or Judicial Office. 2) Agreed Final Settlement Amount of US$470,000. 3) Payment due on Closing Date to Company Y's Account. 4) On the Closing Date, once the payment has been made, each party irrevocably terminates any arbitration and any other claim or action, and vacates any judgments or awards. 5) All claims of any type between Company A and the other parties have been settled. This agreement was signed on 2008-02-04.</p><p><strong>EXHIBIT D7: Draft Clause 5</strong></p><p>[Appellant(s)] will provide written withdrawals and/or cause non-prosecution orders for all Criminal Proceedings (compoundable fraud and all non-compoundable Forgery/use of Forged Document) PRIOR to [Company Y] withdrawing from arbitration or [Appellant(s)] paying a settlement amount.</p><p><strong>EXHIBIT D8: Correspondence regarding the Negotiation Respondent's Lawyer’s Letter dated 18 December 2007 to the [Lawyer's] at [Company A] </strong></p><p>The 4th Draft must be reinstated, as it is mandatory for [Company A] to withdraw its fraud charge (compoundable) and provide non-prosecution orders for the Forgery charges (non-compoundable), before [Company Y] withdraws the arbitration or d, after Company A has made the payment of $470,000. Thus, all Criminal charges must be removed/with withdrawn first, as there is no assurance that the non-compoundable charges will be. This has been the basis of all of our discussions surrounding [Company Y's] concerns regarding the potential risks of Forgery after the [Appellant(s) or the Respondent(s)] have paid out the settlement.</p><p><strong>ISSUE</strong></p><p>Whether the High Court erred in the exercise of its discretion in making this decision? In setting aside the arbitral tribunal's interim award dated December 1, 2009, did the High Court find that such decision was based on the tribunal's view that the concluding agreement dated February 4, 2008, which had been confirmed by the tribunal to have legal validity under both Singapore and Thailand, should have been determined to be an illegitimate agreement for the purpose of stifling action for the commission of non-compoundable forgery in Thailand, and for that reason was incongruent with Singaporean public policy?</p>
